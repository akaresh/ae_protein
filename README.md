# protein autoencoder

## Priorities ##

1.  architectures.py set up
	 - contain all PyTorch Model Class definitions we are using
	 - UPDATE: architectures.py set up, but not tested
2.  add CNN definitions to architectures.py
3.  add method to create distance matrices from fragments
	 - test simple CNN with distance matrices
4.  document all functions and classes
5.  add unittests for functions
	 - probably one in the training functions
5.  implement PEP8 style checking in repo
6.  more efficient fragment cosntruction method
7.  make method for c-beta extended
8.  add fragment method for bb+sc
9.  make a cif writer
10.  improve pymol visualizationn
	 - probably focus on getting pymol to work in a notebook
11. visualize nn input/outputs overlays
12. Build more informative README
	 - include file hiearchy
	 - how to use
